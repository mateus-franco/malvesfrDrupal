11: Adding Actors View and update content:
Actors page view configuration.

12: Merge branch 'main' of github.com:mateus-franco/malvesfrDrupal:
Having created the readme on github brought up an issue with visual studio but I learned how to fix it.

13: Add and configure Blocks:
Creation of blocks to improve the visualization of the pages.

15: Update Views:
I updated the visualization to be in line with Beca's proposal.

16: Download and Install Bootstrap:
Baixei e instalei o Bootstrap para dar início ao processo do sub tema. 

17: Very Happygit add . New Subtheme based on Bootstrap:
That part made me very happy. It was already dawn and I managed to create the subtheme using Bootstrap.

18: Set Subtheme as default:
I put the Subtheme as default.

19: Configure Blocks in new theme:
I did the configuration through drupal of the blocks and views I wanted. When I went to make changes to the CSS I made some mistake and I couldn't identify it. My page no longer opens. I had to download another theme to create a new sub-theme.

20: Redoing sub-theme by mistake in the first one:
As I was going on vacation the following week, I found it most feasible to create a new sub-theme with another theme, as I caused some error with Bootstrap.

<h1>Conclusion after completion of the practical part of Beca</h1>

I was extremely pleased with the way Beca worked. I believe that if I had meetings like the traditional ones, I wouldn't have learned as much as chasing knowledge on my own.

I wish I had taken advantage of the last week to make a new project and make the sub-theme better. As I went on vacation I am delivering it this way but I will make a new one for my knowledge.

Thank you Ruda for the way you led and willingness to help.
